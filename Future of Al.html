            <h2>Future of AI</h2>
            <h3>The future is really UNKNOWN</h3>
            <p>Researchers seem to disagree on a lot of the same issues.
            With the rate at which technology is improving it is logical to believe AI will  continue to get more and more sophisticated.<br>
            But we can imagine two different kind of future of A.I.  They are :<br>
            1- Positive<br>
            2- Negative
            </p>
            
            <h3>Positive imagination of Future</h3>
            <p>Maybe, the day is not far when we will just  sit back in our cozy little beds and just  command our personal Robot's to entirely  do our ruts . He will be a perfect  companion for us. Just enjoy the  Technology.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Negative imagination of Future</h3>
            <p>It may end in other way too. Some day there
            will be a knock at our door. As we open it, we’ll  see a large number of Robots marching into our  house destroying everything we own and  looting you. This is because ever since there is  an advantage in the Technology, it attracts anti-  social elements. This is true for Robots too.
            Because now they will have full power to think  as human, even as of anti-social elements. So  we should think trice before giving them power  of Cognition.
